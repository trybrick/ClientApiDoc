Examples in PHP
==============

PHP, being an extremely flexible and feature-rich language, provides a number of different mechanisms you can choose from to make your REST requests. The ones we recommend are:

- [cURL](http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php)
- [file_get_contents](http://php.net/manual/en/function.file-get-contents.php)

Depending on your web server configuration either one of these functions may be more desirable.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is like XML, but without the markup around the actual payload.

The [json_decode](http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-decode.php) function takes a JSON encoded string and converts it into a PHP variable.

Example retrieving profile

```php
include 'gsnutil.php'; 

```

Example updating profile


```php
include 'gsnutil.php'; 

```
