GSN API Specification and Examples
============
The GSN Web Service API system makes it easy for Retailer, CPG, and Affiliates to better integrate with GSN. This specification document describes how these companies (hereafter “retailers”) can use GSN's RESTful Web Services API to integrate store content and information into their web and mobile applications. This specification is intended for technical personnel developing web and mobile applications, who have a basic understanding of web technologies and protocols. The API’s various requests are arranged into general workflows that a Retailer's client application will use when interacting with the API.
