#Introduction
The GSN Web Service API system makes it easy for Retailer, CPG, and Affiliates
to better integrate with GSN. This specification document
describes how these companies (hereafter “retailers”) can use GSN's RESTful Web Services API to
integrate store content and information into their web and mobile applications.
This specification is intended for technical personnel developing web and mobile applications, who have a
basic understanding of web technologies and protocols.
